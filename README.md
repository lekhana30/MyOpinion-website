MyOpinion (A Web  Application  which  is  used  to   manage  the Feedbacks)</br>
INSTRUCTIONS   TO  RUN  THE  CODE :</br>
•	In the Visual Studio Codes or any other Editors  which you are using in their open the Folder called “MyOpinion”.</br>
•	And then in the terminal/console- run the command: 
npm start </br>
•	There is a line(“start: nodemon index”)inside the package.json file,
here index.js is a file which is the starting point of the project. </br>
•	So by running the npm start command it reaches the starting point and starts by connecting the server to the port (here we have used 9898 as the port).</br>
•	And as we have used the mongoose package to connect to the database ,the mongodb database also gets successfully connected once the server is connected to the port.</br>In the Terminal:
Server Connected</br>
Database Successfully Connected</br>
•	Then in your web browser you will have to use localhost:port-no/MyOpinion as the url which leads to the home page of the MyOpinion web page.</br>
•	You can also check the database stored in mongodb by using the mongodb compass.
